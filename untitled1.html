			<h3>Blog Post One</h3>
			<small>Posted by Bread on July 17</small>
			<p>In this crash course I will cram as much about HTML that I can. This is meant for absolute beginners. If you are interested in learning HTML but know nothing, then you are in the right place. We will be creating a cheat sheet with all of the common HTML5 tags, attributes, semantic markup, etc. We will not be focusing on CSS in this video. The CSS crash course will be released shortly after</p>
